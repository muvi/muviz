[Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so frickin bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Chorus]
Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night oh
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
//Oh oooh Oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire
//Oh oooh Oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire

[Travis "Travie" McCoy]
Yeah I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pit
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had sh-t
Give a few Mercedes like here lady have this
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
Its been a couple months since I've single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah can't forget about me stupid
Everywhere I go Imma have my own theme music

[Chorus]
Oh every time I close my eyes
[what you see, what you see]
I see my name in shining lights [aha aha]
A different city every night oh [yeah yeah]
I swear the world better prepare [for what]
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh Oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh Oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire

[Travis "Travie" McCoy]
I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys completely seperate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatevers left and just split up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
would know what hungry was
Eating good sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

[Chorus]
I wanna be a billionaire so frickin bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Chorus]
Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night oh
I swear the world better prepare 
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh Oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire [singin]
Oh oooh Oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire [oh]

Iwanna be a billionaire so frickin bad [haha]
